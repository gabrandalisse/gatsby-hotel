# 🏨 Gatsby Hotel

Gatsby Hotel it's a landing page made with the JAM Stack.

The front-end was made with Gatsby that allowed to me obtain the data from the back-end (Dato CMS) through GraphQL.
The whole idea around this project was to put all the concepts that I've studied, like SSR and the JAM Stack itself, in practice.
